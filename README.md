=======

## Local development

Run `yarn run dev` to watch for changes in the `resources/js` directory.

Use the local checkout in a project that uses this plugin. [The Composer documentation explains how to do this.](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#path)

To run the tests you need a Nova License and a GitHub App with access to your repository. It will use the workflow `test-workflow.yml` to do integration tests.

Create `/.env` file with the following content:

```dotenv
NOVA_PUBLISH_PRIVATE_KEY="your GitHub App private key"
NOVA_PUBLISH_APPLICATION_ID="your GitHub App ID"
NOVA_PUBLISH_OWNER="your GitHub owner"
NOVA_PUBLISH_REPOSITORY="your GitHub repository"
```

## i18n

To add a language or change an existing translation, please read the [Laravel documentation about overriding package language files](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/localization#overriding-package-language-files).

## GitHub credentials

You need a GitHub App to use this tool. The application must have access to the repository where the workflow is located.

[About creating GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps).

Use the application ID and private key in `config/publish.php`.

## Contribute

You need a Nova license to run the tests.

## Release new version

- Run `yarn run prod` to build the assets, and commit the changes
- Add the new version to `CHANGELOG.md`
